Short Description of the project:

A simple program that can register and provide a simple overview of my personal collection of physical video games. With the help of a simple menu and minor UI the following functions should atleast be implemented:

- Add a game or remove a game from the library
- Add relevant info to the game (or other entities, such as consoles etc)
- Options for sorting games based on different categories (console, publisher, genre, release date etc)
- Option to provide a completion date and keep track of a backlog
- Option to provide an image relevant to the game

This list will most likely expand as the projects moves along
